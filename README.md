Landing Page Bankist App 
Activity from Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course about a virtual bank in Vanilla JS .
This is an activity from Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript Course I followed the course's guidelines but used my own approach.
I resolved the course's challenges writing the code on my own, then watch the instructor's solution so I could learn his way of doing it and 
at the same time develope my own problem solving ability.Really cool course, I highly recommend it.
In this lecture I learned to implement Intersection observer API in order to fire lazy loading in images.Also learned how to code a tabs section
and an images slider that fires when you click its buttons and also when you press right or left key.Deployed @ https://angeli-bankist-landing.netlify.app/
